# PRG2F in ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23f74c00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
Welcome, this is my repository where I re-make the whole [PRG2F](https://github.com/VitaliyAtmnk/PRG) repository, which is a repository full of assignments and information about Java.
<br/>
My own repository where I completed these assignments in Java is [here](https://github.com/Pavel-Sefl/PRG2F).
<br/>
Rust is surprisingly a lot different from other programming languages I've worked with so far. Things like reading a number from the console is much more complicated, however this is in favor of predictable behaviour and memory safety. And I love it.
<br/>
This repository serves as a learning ground for me.
